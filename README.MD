# Google Calendar Desktop

A renderer for Google Calendar in ElectronJS.

The ideia is to start-up along side windows in the tray and have have better use of the calendar, with notifications and similar features.

Motivation: Sometimes I forget to open the calendar until my schedule is already messed up ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
